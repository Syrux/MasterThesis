\block[roundedcorners=40]{Objectif :}{
	\Large
	The objective of this master thesis is to develop a \textbf{scalable} and \textbf{efficient} CP based implementation of the prefix-span algorithm using Spark, and to release the developed algorithm for the benefit of the Spark community.

	\block[roundedcorners=40]{Research based upon :}{
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{PPIC} : \newline
				Developed by John O.R. Aoga during his master thesis, this algorithm offer record breaking performances, \textbf{outperforming specialized system through the use of a generic constraint solver}. The main two improvement being the pre-computation of the positions at which a symbol becomes unsupported by a sequence and the usage of a backtracking-aware data structure that allows fast incremental storing and restoring of the projected database.
				
			\item \textbf{Spark} : \\
				\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
				An \textbf{open source cluster computing framework} providing programmers with an application programming interface centered on a data structure called the \textbf{resilient distributed dataset} (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way.\newline
				
				\textbf{Spark also disposes of a machine learning library}, which already provides an efficient prefix-span based implementation (\textbf{BFS}). The idea is thus to build upon that implementation, to develop a, more efficient, CP based solution.

	\block[roundedcorners=40]{Prefix-span algorithm:}{
		PPIC is based on the \textbf{prefix-span algorithm}. It works by analysing the current sequence to find frequent items, then it extends the current prefix and repeat the process, backtracking when necessary (\textbf{DFS}), thus generating all postfixes incrementally.

	\block[roundedcorners=40]{Flaws of the original algorithms :}{
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{PPIC} :
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The algorithm is not scalable
				\item Although PPIC is ridiculously fast, the \textbf{pre-computation} needed before the algorithm can be run are extremely slow and/or \textbf{consume so much memory that the algorithm crashes}.
			\end{itemize}
				
			\item \textbf{Spark} :
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The algorithm \textbf{searches for permutations even if there are none}, which is a \textbf{huge waste of time and space}.
				\item While searching for permutations, the partialStarts array can grow exponentially large depending on the problem, leading to memory issues and massive slowdowns.
			\end{itemize}
				
				
		\end{itemize}
	}
	
	\block[roundedcorners=40]{Merging the two algorithms, how it solves our problems :}{
		\begin{itemize}
				\item We \textbf{split the search tree using Spark's algorithm} then switch to \textbf{PPIC during the local execution}. This way, the preprocessing matrices are kept to manageable sizes, effectively speeding up the whole algorithm, while making PPIC scalable.
				\item We can modify Spark's original algorithm so it \textbf{doesn't search for permutations uselessly}, as shown in the no permutation algorithm (see graph on the right). We can also switch earlier to a local execution, reducing the cost of transferring the  huge partialStart array around.
